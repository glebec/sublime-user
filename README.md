# Sublime Text Personal Settings

The Sublime Text packages list, snippets, and settings all live inside the User folder. In fact, when Sublime starts, it loads the OS-appropriate package version for each machine based on the packages list in the User folder; thus you do not need to sync the entire Packages folder. Syncing the User folder therefore allows for easy maintenance between devices.

Syncing can also be accomplished using Dropbox and symlinks, but that is a much more brittle and less versatile method compared to git.
